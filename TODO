TODO list for File::BOM

Iron out bugs in the PerlIO::via interface.

  o Investigate bugs in PerlIO::via - patch?
    - patched XS code and tested locally.
    o get patch submitted
      - done! perl 5.8.7 doesn't have this bug

  o There are still problems with PerlIO::via. seek and tell don't work terribly
    well. This really needs to get raised via perlbug, I think. Other
    PerlIO::via modules don't support seek and tell at all.

Test coverage
  o Currently can't get Devel::Cover working on Perlio::via tests.
