Some notes concerning cygwin:

It has been brought to my attention that several tests fail under cygwin, for
that reason those tests will be disabled by default as of version 0.12.

This behaviour can be disabled by setting TEST_FIFO to a true value.

    e.g.

    TEST_FIFO=1 ./Build test

I have been informed that the the cause of this problem has been remedied in
Cygwin dll 1.5.20

It is also worth noting that some exception tests are known to fail under
cygwin. This is because the read() call doesn't return undef on a failure. This
is a problem with perl under cygwin, not with File::BOM.
